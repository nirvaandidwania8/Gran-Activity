# Gran-Activity
1. Idea

Grandparents and elderly people have a lack of physical interaction and also lack the motivation to stay fit which usually leads to excess screen time usage by them.

2. Problem Statement

Grandparents spend most of their day being inactive and do not partake in any physical activities. This device aims at reducing their screen time usage while also keeping them physically active. To design a device which would keep grandparents busy with different activities as much as possible. 

3. SDG's

SDG 3 - Good health and well-being

4. Constraints

1) It would need to be functional without an OLED screen
2) It would need to work across different Wi-Fi networks across cities
3) It must be user-friendly and easy to use
4) Rethink the feasibility of the project and if our idea was the best use for its capabilities
5) It must be aesthetically pleasing to look at

5. Solutions Brainstorming

After researching for similar products and solutions we were unable to find any device that addressed the problem like our project proposed to and most of the existing similar ideas were in the forms of apps, which neglects one of our primary concerns, limiting screen time usage. Some apps that had a similar idea of keeping elderly people more active include, ‘Map My Walk’, ‘Yoga Studio’ and ‘MedWatcher’.
